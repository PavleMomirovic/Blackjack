# Blackjack
Problem done in Java (using Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers - 2022-03)
Java version is 1.8.0_311
Cards.java and Deck.java are classes that were given to me to use them to solve a problem with maximising player's profits in a simplified blackjack game. 
Blackjack.java is a class that uses Deck.shuffle() to create a random deck scenarios and outputs the max profit that a player can make in that scenario.
